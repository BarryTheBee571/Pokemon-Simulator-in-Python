# Pokemon-Simulator-in-Python
Final project for Python Programming course 

This is my final project for the USC Course ITP 115. Using object-oriented programming concepts, I created a Pokemon battle simulator that has similar functionality as the actual games. This program only includes the first 151 original Pokemon. 

I mainly scraped data from existing CSVs with Pokemon data online. Using the data from the CSVs, I converted each line of the spreadsheet into a Pokemon object. I used another CSV to create objects for Pokemon attacks as well. All formulas for calculations came from Bulbapedia.
